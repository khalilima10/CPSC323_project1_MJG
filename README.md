#  Title: Project 1 Lexer/Scanner
## Quick Summary 
_____
#### This project is a fully functional scanner by using a function named lexer() to go through the tokens given in a text file and output the tokens with their corresponding lexemes in columns.
## Code Runthrough 
___
-The code begins by taking the input from the sourcecode file and using multiple functions to go through it.

-The blank spaces are removed so we are able to establish what each input really is. 

-The input is then categorized based upon what the character/symbol/number is. 

-The categories are real, keyword, identifier, separator, and operator. 

-After giving each token a lexeme the tokens are written into an output file with their corresponding lexemes seperated into columns.
